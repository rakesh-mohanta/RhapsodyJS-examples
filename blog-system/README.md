# Super basic blog system with RhapsodyJS

It uses Hogan.js as template engine, but due some problems with consolidate, I couldn't register Hogan.js in the `template-engines` options, so see the `app/config/bootstrap.js` file to see how I did it !

The login system and how I expose the blog info to be used inside templates can be seen in the middlewares =)
